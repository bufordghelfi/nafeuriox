Long story short, I'm currently affected by a glitch preventing me from unlocking the achievement for learning how to craft Electric Arrows, even after completing the challenge. Apparently this is caused by obtaining the Electric Arrow blueprint in The Following before earning it in Bozak Horde. Now I've been away from the game for quite some time so I don't remember how the Bozak Horde is integrated in the campaign. If I start a new game, how long will it be before I can start the Bozark.

Dying Light is an action survival game presented in first-person perspective and set in a vast and dangerous open world. During the day, you roam an urban environment devastated by a mysterious epidemic, scavenging for supplies and crafting weapons to help you defeat the hordes of mindless, flesh-hungry enemies the plague has created. On my first playthrough of the game I played on hard and got through Bozak horde with virals only taking 1 hit to the head to kill. I've decided to start a new save on normal and doing Bozak Horde now takes 3-4 hits to the head to kill the virals. I mean, after the first three trials my machete is already broken. This can't be right. Is this a bug or?

Dying Light is a first-person, action survival game set in a vast open world. Roam a city devastated by a mysterious epidemic, scavenging for supplies and crafting weapons to help defeat the hordes of flesh-hungry enemies the plague has created. I'm going to try the Bozak horde for the first time after I level up my legend skill tree a bit more but I've got a few questions. 1. If you die during one of the trials do you have to start from the beginning or do you start from the beginning of that trial? 2. What should I level up in my legend skill tree? So far I've only put 2 points into 1 handed melee weapons 3. How difficult is it with low legend levels. –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∏–≥—Ä—É —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç Dying Light: The Bozak Horde —Å —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –∏ –±–µ–∑ —Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏. someone wants So basically I want to finish these challenges but I tried to do them alone and it is just really hard.

I bought this game and i am playing for the first time with all the dlc installed. I have not finished the game so PLEASE NO SPOILERS but i was wondering what the best time ingame is to start the bozak horde. I am assuming you get to play through it once ingame and i wanted the best point storywise because i dont know how the ending of this game works. 
Bozak is a character featured in Dying Light. He is also the primary antagonist of the expansion pack The Bozak Horde. Scattered throughout the Old Town district of Harran are nine posters which offer various combat and free-running challenges for Kyle Crane to complete. After examining. Every time I drop out of a multiplayer game I spawn in the Bozak horde area and am forced to reequip all my items and clothes, it has become infuriating. I make sure I have another quest selected before I enter a multiplayer game but despite that when I drop out I still spawn in the Bozak horde area, does anyone else have this problem where it spawns you there despite having another quest selected before? Is there a possible solution.
